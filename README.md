# Baptiste Audugé's portfolio

This is my portfolio, you can find all my experiences, projects and some words about me.
You can find it [here](https://www.auduge.com/).

This portfolio is made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SAAS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

The original design is from [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7), but I made some changes to fit my needs.
Crafted with ❤️ by Baptiste Audugé.
